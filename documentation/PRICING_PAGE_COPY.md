## FAQ SECTION

```
Frequently Asked Questions
Everything you need to know before you start
```

**Q: How is this different from regular sales training?**
A: Traditional training = one-and-done classroom sessions. Our platform = ongoing practice anytime you want, with AI that feels like a real prospect. It's like having a sparring partner for sales calls, available 24/7.

**Q: Will the AI sound robotic?**
A: No. Our AI uses advanced voice synthesis and responds contextually like a real buyer. Most reps say it's "eerily realistic." Try the free tier and judge for yourself.

**Q: Do I need any special equipment?**
A: Nope. Just a computer or phone with a microphone and speakers/headset. It works in your browser. No downloads, no installation.

**Q: How long does it take to see results?**
A: Most reps see improvement in their first week. Sarah (AE) closed 2 extra deals in month one. The key is consistency: 10-15 minutes of practice 3x per week.

**Q: What if I don't like it?**
A: You get a full refund. Free tier is $0 forever (no risk). Paid plans have 30-90 day money-back guarantees. If you're not closing more deals, we don't deserve your money.

**Q: Can I cancel anytime?**
A: Yes. No contracts, no commitments. Cancel in one click from your account settings.

**Q: Do you offer training or onboarding?**
A: Free tier is self-serve (takes 2 minutes). Pro/Ultra have video tutorials. Team plans include email support. Professional/Enterprise include dedicated onboarding and training with our team.

**Q: What methodologies do you support?**
A: All of them. You can customize scorecards to any methodology: MEDDIC, SPIN, Challenger, Sandler, Gap Selling, NEAT, BANT - whatever you use.

**Q: Can I use this for hiring?**
A: Yes! Our hiring assessment feature lets candidates take AI roleplay tests. You get objective scores to compare candidates. Teams and higher plans include this.

**Q: What integrations do you offer?**
A: Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, Gong, Chorus, Outreach, SalesLoft, Slack, Microsoft Teams, and 15+ more. Enterprise plans include custom integrations.

**Q: Is my data secure?**
A: Extremely. We use bank-level encryption (AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit). We're SOC 2 Type II compliant. We NEVER train AI models on your data. Your calls and data are yours alone.

**Q: Can I try before I buy?**
A: Absolutely. Our free tier gives you full access to practice calls forever. No credit card required. Upgrade when you're ready.
