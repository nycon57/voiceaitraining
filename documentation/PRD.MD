Audio Agent Sales Training SaaS – Product Requirements & Implementation Plan

Overview

This SaaS platform provides an AI-driven audio role-play training environment for sales teams. It simulates realistic phone call conversations between a sales representative (trainee) and various personas (clients, business partners, recruits) to practice and refine sales skills. The focus is industry-agnostic (starting with loan officers) and aims to reinforce both general sales best practices and organization-specific techniques. Each simulated conversation (a “scenario” or “scene”) has a target outcome (e.g. book an appointment, close a sale, persuade a recruit) and is designed to train the rep to achieve key performance indicators (KPIs) for that interaction.

In these sessions, an AI voice agent acts as the customer or counterpart. The conversation is conducted via real-time audio: the trainee speaks naturally, and the AI agent listens and responds like a human ￼. The system records and transcribes each dialogue, then analyzes performance against defined metrics. Trainees receive immediate feedback and a score, while managers and admins gain insights through dashboards, leaderboards, and notifications. This safe practice environment allows reps to hone pitches, build confidence, and improve communication skills through iterative practice ￼ ￼, ultimately leading to better real-world conversion rates.

Objectives and Key Features
	•	Realistic Role-Play Training: Provide life-like, AI-powered call simulations so salespeople can practice conversations in a low-risk setting ￼. The AI agent should emulate real customer behaviors (e.g. asking questions, raising objections, displaying hesitation) to make scenarios authentic ￼.
	•	Personalized Feedback and Scoring: Deliver instant evaluation of each call – assessing criteria like tone, delivery, product knowledge, and conversation effectiveness ￼. Reps receive scores and detailed feedback (including transcripts annotated with comments and AI suggestions for improvement). The system tracks progress over time, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement for each rep ￼.
	•	KPI Metrics Tracking: Measure critical performance metrics for every scenario. Globally, track things like talk-to-listen ratio (how much the rep talked vs listened) – an important metric since research shows top salespeople only talk ~43% of the time on calls ￼. Also track filler word count, speaking pace, and sentiment. Per scenario, track specific KPIs: e.g. did the rep handle objections appropriately, ask open-ended questions, mention all required product features, or achieve the scenario’s goal (such as scheduling a follow-up). These metrics feed into scoring and help quantify skill development.
	•	Scenario Management: Allow creation and management of training scenarios. Admins can author scenarios manually (writing dialogues, defining expected behaviors) or use AI assistance to generate scenario content (e.g. given a scenario brief, use an LLM to draft a realistic conversation flow). Each scenario can include branching logic to handle different trainee responses – ensuring the conversation dynamically adapts rather than following a rigid script. This branching creates a choose-your-own-adventure style simulation where the AI’s next response depends on what the trainee says, enabling truly interactive role-play. Scenarios are grouped into tracks (or curricula) for structured training programs (e.g. “Loan Officer Onboarding – Track 1” might include several scenarios like introductory call, objection handling, compliance discussion, etc.).
	•	Enterprise Management & Analytics: Provide an enterprise-grade management system for organizations. This includes robust user management with roles and permissions (detailed below), the ability to assign training requirements, and oversight of performance:
	•	Managers and Admins can assign scenarios or tracks to individual salespeople or groups (e.g. all new hires must complete the “New Hire Track”). They can set due dates and receive alerts for overdue training.
	•	The platform collects results and presents analytics dashboards. This includes individual report cards and team-wide metrics: average scores, completion rates, improvement over time, distribution of talk/listen ratios, etc. Leaderboards foster healthy competition, showing top performers in various categories (highest average score, fastest improvement, etc.).
	•	Notifications & Alerts: Automated notifications can be sent via email (using Resend) to relevant parties based on triggers. For example, upon scenario completion, the trainee gets an email summary of their performance; their manager can be CC’d especially if the score falls below a threshold or if the scenario is a required compliance module. Managers/HR could receive alerts if a rep repeatedly underperforms or misses training deadlines.
	•	Integration Capabilities: Ensure the system can integrate with external tools. Initially, this will be via webhooks (outgoing HTTP callbacks) for simplicity. Admins can configure webhook endpoints to receive events such as “Scenario Completed”, “Training Track Completed”, or “User Performance Alert”. For each event type, the admin can toggle automatic triggers. For example, an admin might set up a webhook to the company’s CRM or Slack, to be invoked automatically whenever a scenario is completed (sending the rep’s name, scenario, score, and transcript link) or only when manually triggered. The webhook payload would include key data like:

{
  "event": "scenario_completed",
  "organization": "Acme Inc",
  "user": { "id": "u123", "name": "Alice Doe", "email": "alice@acme.com", "role": "Sales Trainee" },
  "scenario": { "id": "scen45", "title": "Loan Objection Handling" },
  "score": 85,
  "metrics": {
    "talk_listen_ratio": "45:55",
    "keywords_mentioned": ["refinance", "interest rate", "closing timeline"],
    "duration": 300
  },
  "completed_at": "2025-09-20T22:15:30Z"
}

Admins can provision multiple webhook endpoints (e.g. one for CRM, one for an internal HR system) and specify which events go to which endpoint. We will include secure signing of webhook payloads (HMAC secret) so the receiving system can verify authenticity. In future phases, direct integrations with popular CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.) and communication tools (Slack, MS Teams) will be added for seamless data syncing ￼, but webhooks provide a flexible starting point for custom integration needs.

	•	Payment & Subscription Management: The platform will be a subscription-based SaaS, integrated with Stripe for billing. Organizations can sign up for a plan (tiered by number of users or features). Stripe will handle secure payment processing, subscription renewals, and invoices. We’ll implement Stripe Checkout for initial payment and Stripe’s Customer Portal for self-service subscription management (update payment method, upgrade plan, etc.). The system will restrict features or user counts based on plan (using, for example, a middleware to check entitlements by plan level ￼). A free trial or free tier could be offered to encourage adoption (perhaps limiting number of scenarios or AI minutes).

User Roles and Permissions

We will support multiple user roles, each with specific permissions and views in the system:
	•	Sales Trainee (Rep): The primary end-user who takes the training simulations. They can log in and see their assigned scenarios/tracks, their progress and scores, and playback of past conversations (with transcripts and feedback). They can initiate new practice sessions (if enabled) beyond required scenarios for extra training. They have access to personal analytics (e.g. their average scores, historical improvement) and can see leaderboards (likely anonymized or first-name for others, depending on company preference).
	•	Manager/Coach: Typically a team lead or coach who oversees a group of trainees. Managers can assign training to their team members (either individually or by choosing from predefined tracks). They have a dashboard to monitor their team’s performance: completion rates, scores, and comparative metrics. Managers can review each trainee’s call recordings and transcripts, see the AI-generated feedback, and add their own feedback or coaching notes. They receive notifications when their team members complete scenarios or if someone is struggling. Managers cannot create new scenario content in the base version (unless also given admin rights), but they can choose from existing scenarios to assign.
	•	Administrator (Org Admin): The admin has full control over the organization’s instance. They manage users (invite new users via email through Clerk, assign roles, deactivate users, etc.), create and edit scenarios, and organize scenarios into tracks or curricula. Admins configure system-wide settings such as integration webhooks, notification rules, and company branding (e.g. logo on the dashboard, email templates). They also have access to all analytics across the organization. In smaller companies, one person might be both Admin and Manager, but we separate for larger enterprises.
	•	HR/Training Officer: This is an optional role for organizations where HR or a training department needs oversight. HR users have read-only access to training compliance data – e.g. they can see who has completed required trainings (and who hasn’t), and can pull reports on performance for personnel records. They receive notifications on training completion or issues if configured (for instance, an HR person might get an alert if an employee fails a mandatory compliance scenario). HR users typically cannot edit content or assignments; they are observers and record-keepers for compliance purposes.

Permission Matrix (Summary):
	•	Trainee: View own assignments and results; start training calls; view own feedback and leaderboards.
	•	Manager: All trainee permissions; assign scenarios to direct reports; view team results (calls, transcripts, scores); receive team notifications; add coaching comments.
	•	Admin: All manager permissions across entire org; create/edit scenarios and tracks; manage all users and roles; configure integrations and notifications; manage subscription and billing; view all data.
	•	HR: Limited to viewing overall training completion and compliance status; view results for record-keeping; cannot modify content or assignments.

(The platform will allow flexible role assignment. For instance, some organizations might not use the HR role at all, or a user can be both a Manager and an Admin. Permissions will be additive in such cases.)

Training Scenarios & Content Creation

Scenario Definition: A scenario (or “scene”) is a simulated conversation with a specific context and goal. For example, “Handling a Mortgage Rate Objection” might be a scenario where the AI acts as a skeptical client and the trainee must convince them to proceed with a loan application. Each scenario has metadata like title, description, role of the AI agent (client/partner/recruit), difficulty level, estimated duration, and learning objectives/KPIs.

Creation & Authoring: The platform supports multiple ways to create scenarios:
	•	Manual Authoring: Admins can manually create scenarios via a rich editor. They can define an initial script or conversation outline, specify the persona (e.g. Client persona: first-time homebuyer with credit concerns), and list expected paths or key points. The admin can also define branch points – e.g. at a certain point, if the trainee mentions price, the AI should respond one way; if the trainee doesn’t mention it, the AI might prompt them. The UI might allow creating a decision tree of dialogue or using a flowchart interface to map out branches. Even in manually authored scenarios, the AI agent isn’t strictly reading from a script – it uses an LLM to handle unexpected inputs while following the authored guidance. The admin can provide example answers for the AI and define correct or ideal trainee responses to guide evaluation.
	•	AI-Generated Scenarios: To speed content creation, admins can use an AI assistant. They might input a prompt such as: “Create a scenario where the salesperson calls a client who is undecided about refinancing their mortgage. The goal is to schedule an in-person meeting by the end. Include one objection about interest rates.” The system (leveraging the Vercel AI SDK with an LLM like GPT-4) will generate a draft scenario: including the persona’s profile, a possible conversation flow, and suggestions for metrics to track (e.g. did the rep counter the interest rate objection). The admin can then review and tweak this generated scenario. This feature dramatically reduces the time to develop new training content and ensures a wide variety of scenarios.
	•	Branching & Dynamic Conversations: Scenarios are not linear scripts; they support branching logic and dynamic responses. For example, if a trainee asks an unexpected question, the AI agent (powered by the LLM) can handle it in stride, pulling from its knowledge or scenario context to respond appropriately. Admins can set up specific branches for anticipated decision points (e.g. if trainee offers a discount vs doesn’t offer it), and the scenario will follow the relevant path. If a trainee goes completely off-script, the AI’s LLM brain will still attempt to respond coherently, then gently steer back to the scenario goals if possible. This ensures authentic, two-way interactivity, mimicking real conversations where the path is not predetermined. Such branching scenarios in e-learning are known to improve decision-making skills by letting trainees experience the consequences of different choices ￼.
	•	Reusable Templates: The system may include a library of template scenarios (especially for common sales situations like cold call intro, handling pricing objections, etc.). Admins can clone and modify these for their org. This is especially helpful as we expand to multiple industries – e.g. a template for a “Product Demo Call” can be adapted to a software sales context or an insurance context by tweaking details.

Scoring Rubric per Scenario: Along with scenario content, admins (or the AI generator) define how that scenario will be evaluated. This can include:
	•	Goal Achievement: Did the trainee reach the end goal (yes/no or partial)? E.g. if the goal was to get a meeting scheduled, did the trainee successfully get the AI (client) to agree? This could be an automatic pass/fail metric.
	•	Key Points: Identify crucial actions or phrases. For example: “Mention rate options”, “Ask at least two open-ended questions”, “Attempt a close at least once”. Using transcript analysis (keyword spotting or semantic analysis via the LLM), the system can check these. Some points could be mandatory (if missed, scenario is failed or heavily penalized).
	•	Conversation Quality Metrics: These include the talk-listen ratio, filler words, average response time (did the rep pause too long or interrupt?), sentiment (was the rep’s tone positive and empathetic?), etc. The AI can assess sentiment/tone from the audio or text ￼ and give a score for “professionalism” or “empathy.”
	•	Overall Score: Weigh the above factors to compute a numeric score (e.g. 0–100 or 0–10 scale). For instance, goal achievement might be 50% of score, key points 30%, quality metrics 20%. The exact rubric can be scenario-specific (some scenarios might emphasize different skills). The system will provide default weighting but allow customization per scenario or globally.

Transcription and Recording: Every call is recorded (dual-channel if possible, separating trainee and AI speech) and automatically transcribed to text. The transcription can be done via integrated speech-to-text services – for example, using Deepgram or AssemblyAI via the Vapi integration ￼, or leveraging OpenAI Whisper via the Vercel AI SDK. The transcription accuracy is important for evaluation; using proven STT engines like Deepgram ensures accurate capture of the trainee’s words ￼. The audio recordings are saved (e.g. in Supabase Storage or an integrated cloud storage) so the trainee and manager can replay the call. Having the transcripts allows the system to highlight where in the conversation certain things happened (e.g. “Here the customer gave an objection about rates, but you did not address it.”). Transcripts also enable quick search within calls and are used by the AI for analysis and feedback generation.

Conversation Simulation via Voice AI Agents

At the core of the product is the voice AI agent that converses with the trainee. Here’s how the simulation works under the hood:
	•	Voice Interface: The trainee can use a web browser (microphone access) or a phone line to conduct the call. In the browser, we’ll use WebRTC or a similar technology to capture audio and play the AI agent’s voice. If using phone, the system (via Vapi) will dial out to the trainee’s phone and then connect the AI agent on the other end. For the MVP, a browser-based experience is simpler (no telephony charges for the user), but offering a phone call option could be useful for realism (practicing as if on a real phone). Vapi supports both inbound and outbound calls at scale ￼ ￼.
	•	Vapi Integration: We leverage Vapi.ai, a developer platform for building voice AI agents. Vapi provides the telephony infrastructure and API for managing calls, as well as integration points for AI. Our application will use Vapi to manage call flows and real-time audio streaming. Vapi’s API-first approach and built-in configurations allow us to connect the call with our AI logic easily ￼ ￼. We can use Vapi’s visual flow builder or API to define the call workflow: start call, greet user, listen for input, get AI response, etc. Notably, Vapi allows us to “bring our own” AI components – we can plug in our chosen speech-to-text service, language model, and text-to-speech voice ￼. This flexibility is crucial: for example, we might use OpenAI GPT-4 for language understanding and response generation, Deepgram for transcription, and ElevenLabs for a realistic human-like voice for the agent. (Vapi also offers default integrations for these: it natively supports OpenAI, Anthropic, ElevenLabs, Deepgram, AssemblyAI, Twilio, and more ￼.)
	•	AI Agent Logic: When the call starts, the AI agent runs a loop of: listen → process → respond. Specifically:
	•	The agent “listens” to the trainee via live audio capture. Vapi will send the audio stream to our STT engine (e.g. Deepgram) which transcribes it in real-time.
	•	The transcribed text (the trainee’s last utterance) is then fed, along with conversation context, into the LLM (Large Language Model) that powers the agent’s brain. We maintain a conversation state (dialog history and scenario info) and prompt the LLM with this state and any scenario-specific instructions. For example, the prompt might include: “You are playing the role of an undecided customer. The rep’s goal is to schedule a meeting. If the rep mentions interest rates, you should express concern about high rates,” etc. The LLM uses this to decide the best response, effectively making the agent behave in character.
	•	The LLM’s response (text) is then converted to speech via TTS (text-to-speech). Using a service like ElevenLabs gives a very natural voice output, possibly even with a chosen voice persona (e.g. a calm older male voice for a certain client persona). Vapi (or our app) sends this synthesized audio back to the trainee. The trainee hears the AI’s answer and the cycle continues.
	•	Feels Human: The goal is for this interaction to feel like a real phone call. With advanced TTS, we can achieve natural intonation. The agent can be configured to have a slight pause or say “hmm” to mimic human cadence. Multi-turn conversation is fully supported – the LLM is keeping track of the conversation so far. Vapi’s platform is capable of handling large volumes of such calls with low latency, ensuring a smooth real-time dialogue experience (99.99% uptime on their voice API ￼ for reliability).
	•	Automated Call Flow Control: In addition to pure AI-driven behavior, certain scenario structures might use deterministic call flow logic. For example, if the trainee hasn’t spoken for 10 seconds, the system can play a prompt like “Are you still there?”. Or if a trainee says a specific keyword (maybe a safe-word like “reset”), the system could pause or restart the scenario. Vapi allows designing such conditional logic in the workflow (via their flow builder or API hooks) ￼. This ensures that while the content of the conversation is AI-driven, the overall session remains under our control for training purposes.
	•	Recording & Monitoring: Vapi can automatically record calls, but we may also independently record via the browser stream for redundancy. During a call, we have the option to live-monitor it (for example, a manager could silently listen in for live coaching, though this is likely a later feature not MVP). For now, recordings are available right after the call for playback.

Overall, the simulation leverages a combination of real-time speech tech and AI. By using Vapi and the Vercel AI SDK together, we focus on scenario design and AI logic, while those tools handle heavy lifting like telephony, audio streaming, and model integration. This modern stack makes it possible to build a complex voice AI solution relatively quickly ￼ ￼.

Evaluation, Feedback, and KPI Tracking

After each scenario call, the trainee receives feedback and the session is logged for analysis. Key components of the post-call process:
	•	Automated Evaluation: Immediately after the call, the platform runs an evaluation pipeline:
	•	The transcript of the call is analyzed by an AI (using an LLM via Vercel AI SDK) to identify important moments and measure metrics. For instance, the AI looks for points where the customer (AI agent) gave an objection and whether the trainee addressed it effectively. It can flag if the trainee missed a crucial question or gave incorrect information.
	•	Predefined KPI metrics are calculated. The talk-to-listen ratio is computed from the transcript timestamps or audio lengths (e.g. “Agent spoke 40%, Trainee 60%”). If the ratio is off from the ideal (e.g. trainee spoke too much), the feedback will note that, possibly referencing best practice research (like Gong’s 43:57 golden ratio ￼). Other metrics include: total call duration, number of questions asked by trainee, instances of interrupting (if the trainee talked over the agent, detectable by overlapping audio or timing), filler words count (“um”, “uh”), and sentiment analysis of the trainee’s tone (e.g. measured by an AI model to gauge if the trainee sounded confident or unsure).
	•	Scenario-specific checks: The system goes through the scenario’s rubric. For each key point, it searches the transcript. This might be keyword-based (e.g. did trainee mention “interest rate”?) or semantic (using the LLM to confirm if the trainee offered a specific rebuttal). It marks each item as achieved or not.
	•	Scoring: Based on the above, a score is computed. This could be a weighted sum, and the breakdown is stored (so we know, for instance, the trainee got 20/30 points for covering key points, 15/20 for conversation technique, etc.).
	•	AI-Generated Feedback Summary: Using the transcript and analysis data, the system generates a feedback report in natural language. This might read like: “Great effort! You established rapport well with the client and asked several open-ended questions (good job keeping a ~45:55 talk-listen ratio, which is near the ideal range ￼). You addressed the interest rate objection by explaining our competitive rates – well done. However, you missed an opportunity to ask about the client’s timeline, which is important. Next time, try to ask about their expected timeline. Also, be mindful of filler words; I counted about 5 ‘um’s – reducing those will make you sound more confident. Overall, you scored 85. Keep up the good work on rapport-building, and focus on the suggested improvements for an even better score next time.” The tone is constructive and encouraging. We will tune the LLM prompt to produce feedback in this style. (If needed, the feedback can be templated or partially rule-based for consistency, but an LLM allows a personalized touch referencing actual conversation moments.)
	•	Human Feedback & Review: Managers can later add comments on the trainee’s performance, but the system’s immediate feedback is available right after the call. Trainees can review the full transcript and even listen to the recording. They might see certain parts highlighted (e.g. red highlight where they missed a key action, green where they did something well). This visual timeline paired with feedback helps in self-learning.
	•	Leaderboard & Gamification: The trainee’s new score feeds into leaderboards in the system. Leaderboards can be at the team level or company level, and can be filtered by scenario or track. For example, there might be a “Top Performers this Month (Average Score)” board, or “Best Objection Handlers” for a specific scenario about objections. This gamification aspect motivates participants to improve and engage in some friendly competition. (Leaderboards can be optionally disabled or anonymized by org choice, recognizing some companies might not want competitive pressure.)
	•	Progress Tracking: Over time, the system tracks each trainee’s progress. They can see graphs of their scores improving, badges or achievements for milestones (e.g. “Completed 5 scenarios”, “Improved score 20% since last month”). Managers can see at a glance who is improving and who might need extra coaching. If someone consistently scores low on a particular skill (say, closing the call), the manager could assign additional training focusing on that skill.

The combination of these features ensures that the training isn’t just an isolated exercise – it’s part of a larger improvement plan. The analytics and feedback loop allow continuous development, making the platform a comprehensive sales coaching solution and not just a one-off quiz. By quantifying soft skills (like listening, handling objections) into trackable data, we give organizations a way to measure and elevate their salesforce’s communication abilities ￼.

Enterprise Management Features

For enterprise readiness, we include a robust set of management features beyond the training scenarios themselves:
	•	Multi-Tenant Organization Support: The platform is inherently multi-tenant – each company (client of our SaaS) has its own isolated workspace. Data is partitioned by organization. Users are invited to an organization and their roles are scoped within it. (We will use a combination of Clerk for authentication and Supabase for authorization data to manage this. Clerk may handle the user accounts, while a mapping of users to Org and Role is stored in Supabase. Alternatively, Clerk’s organization feature can be utilized if it supports multiple roles per org.)
	•	User Management: Admins can invite users via email (Clerk will handle sending invitation emails and onboarding, or we can use Resend to send a custom invite with a link). Admins can deactivate users or change roles through an interface. We will provide integration with SSO (SAML/OAuth enterprise SSO) in later iterations for larger clients, but not necessarily in v1. Administrators can also create groups or teams (to mirror the company’s hierarchy, e.g. West Coast Sales Team vs East Coast Sales Team) – useful for assigning training in bulk or viewing team-specific leaderboards.
	•	Assignment & Curriculum: Admins/Managers can assign individual scenarios or entire tracks to users or teams. A track is a sequence of scenarios (with a recommended order). They can mark some scenarios or tracks as required (with due dates). The system will send reminder emails to trainees for upcoming or overdue training. It will also allow managers to manually nudge or reset an assignment (e.g. if someone needs to retake a scenario, an admin can re-open it for them).
	•	Content Management: All scenarios and tracks created by an Admin are accessible in a content library. Admins can edit scenarios (we’ll have versioning or draft mode so editing doesn’t affect in-progress training). They can also import/export scenarios – potentially to share scenarios between organizations or from a central repository (for example, we may offer a marketplace or library of expert-designed scenarios in future).
	•	Analytics Dashboard: The admin dashboard offers both high-level and granular views:
	•	High-Level: Overall training completion percentage, average score across the org, number of scenarios completed this week, etc. Perhaps a visualization of score distribution or improvement over time.
	•	By Scenario/Track: See how different scenarios are performing – e.g. average score on “Cold Call Introduction” is 78%, whereas “Rate Objection Handling” is 65%, indicating more people struggle with the latter, which might inform additional coaching or content tweaks.
	•	By User: Pick any user and view their profile with all scenario attempts, scores, strengths/weaknesses, and trend lines. Managers will see this for their team; Admins for anyone.
	•	Compare Teams: If the org has multiple teams or departments, and roles like Manager are tied to teams, an admin could compare performance between teams (this could be useful for sales competitions or identifying high-performing managers).
	•	Notifications & Escalations: We touched on email notifications. To elaborate: Admins can configure who gets notified for what. For example:
	•	Trainee notifications: confirmation and feedback after each scenario (always on, to the trainee). Reminders 2 days before a training due date, etc.
	•	Manager notifications: could opt into immediate alerts when a team member completes a scenario (with score), or maybe a daily digest of training activity. Definitely an alert if a team member fails a scenario (score below threshold) or misses a deadline.
	•	HR notifications: weekly report of overall compliance, or instant notification if someone hasn’t completed a mandatory scenario by deadline (for compliance training).
	•	Admin notifications: billing or usage related (e.g. if voice minutes approach plan limit), and any system-wide issues.
	•	These notifications are sent via email by default (Resend service), but in future could integrate with Slack or Microsoft Teams webhooks for real-time channel notifications.
	•	Security & Privacy: Because call recordings and transcripts might contain sensitive information (even if fictional scenarios, reps might use real client names accidentally), we treat data privacy seriously. All recordings and transcripts are stored securely (Supabase storage is behind authenticated URLs; we can encrypt data at rest if needed). Access to another person’s recordings is restricted by role (managers can only see their team’s, etc.). We will comply with relevant data protection laws (GDPR, etc.) as needed by offering data export/delete for a user upon request. From an app security standpoint, we use role-based access checks on every API route and in the UI to ensure users only access authorized data. Clerk helps secure the authentication process (with options like 2FA if needed).
	•	Scalability & Performance: The system is built on scalable serverless infrastructure (Next.js API routes running on Vercel, and Supabase Postgres which can scale vertically and horizontally). Each conversation uses compute for AI processing; we will manage this by leveraging streaming where possible and efficient use of tokens (the Vercel AI SDK helps with streaming responses for low latency). Vapi as a service is built to handle high call volumes (currently powering millions of calls ￼), so the voice layer should scale. We will monitor usage (like how many concurrent calls) and possibly impose limits per organization based on plan (e.g. max X call minutes per month for the basic plan, etc., with overage billing via Stripe if needed).

Tech Stack

The project will be built with a modern, proven tech stack that supports rapid development, scalability, and integration of AI/voice capabilities. Key components include:
	•	Next.js (React framework) – Next.js will serve as the core of the web application, supporting both the marketing site and the web app. We’ll use the latest App Router for a streamlined structure ￼. Next.js enables server-side rendering for good performance and SEO (for the marketing pages), and client-side interactivity for the app. Its API Routes or Edge Functions will be used for backend logic (e.g. webhooks, orchestrating AI calls) without needing a separate server.
	•	Tailwind CSS + ShadCN/UI – For UI, we’ll adopt Tailwind CSS for low-level utility styling, and ShadCN/UI as a component library. ShadCN provides a set of beautifully designed, accessible React components that we can use as building blocks (buttons, forms, modals, tables, etc.) ￼. This accelerates development and ensures a consistent look-and-feel. The design will be clean and modern, and since ShadCN is built on Radix UI underneath, we get accessibility out of the box.
	•	Supabase (Database & Backend services) – Supabase will serve as our primary database (a hosted PostgreSQL) and provide additional backend features:
	•	Database: All application data (user profiles, orgs, scenarios, assignments, results, transcripts metadata, etc.) will be stored in Postgres tables. Using Supabase allows us to write row-level security policies for multi-tenancy (ensuring users can only see their org’s data) if needed. It also gives us instant REST and GraphQL APIs if we want to leverage them alongside Next.js API routes.
	•	Auth: While we plan to use Clerk for front-end auth, Supabase could be a fallback for certain auth or we might revisit using Supabase Auth for simplicity in some cases. The Vercel Starter kits demonstrate using Supabase Auth + Stripe for SaaS ￼, but here Clerk will cover the auth and user management piece for an improved developer experience and features like organization invites.
	•	Storage: Supabase Storage will be used to store audio recordings and possibly other assets (like scenario images or attachments if any). This gives an S3-compatible bucket with CDN, making it easy to store and serve media securely.
	•	Edge Functions: We can use Supabase Edge Functions (which are serverless functions) for certain tasks if needed (for example, heavy background processing, or as a secure backend for webhooks if not using Next API routes).
	•	Real-time: Supabase real-time subscriptions could be used to push updates to the UI (e.g. update a leaderboard live, or show in real-time that a user has finished a call). This is not critical for v1 but is a nice-to-have for a snappy UX.
	•	Vercel AI SDK – This SDK will allow us to seamlessly integrate AI features in our TypeScript codebase. It provides a unified interface to call various AI models and handle streaming responses, function calling, etc. ￼. In our app, the AI SDK will be used in multiple ways:
	•	LLM for Conversation & Analysis: We’ll use OpenAI’s GPT-4 (or similar large model) via the AI SDK to power the conversation agent’s brain and to analyze transcripts for feedback. The SDK will make it easier to manage the context and prompt templates for these interactions.
	•	Voice Integration: The Vercel AI SDK can also integrate with voice AI providers. For instance, Vercel AI SDK has providers for ElevenLabs which we can use to transcribe audio and generate speech ￼. However, since we’re using Vapi for real-time voice, we might rely on Vapi’s integrations for STT/TTS. Still, for any offline processing (like transcribing a saved recording or generating an audio file), the AI SDK with ElevenLabs is handy.
	•	AI Generation (Scenarios & Feedback): We will use the SDK to call OpenAI (or Anthropic’s Claude, etc., whichever is best) for generating scenario content and feedback text. The advantage of the SDK is a consistent API and easier swapping of models or providers in the future.
	•	Vapi (Voice AI Platform) – As described, Vapi is critical for the voice agent functionality. We will use the Vapi Server SDK for call control and possibly the Client SDK to integrate into our Next.js app for web calling ￼. The platform’s ability to connect to real phone numbers and handle telephony at scale means we don’t have to build that from scratch ￼. Vapi also provides a web dashboard which we might use during development to design call flows and test agents. We’ll incorporate Vapi’s API calls into our backend (e.g. an API route “/api/start-call” that our front-end calls when a trainee clicks “Start Scenario” – this route would request Vapi to initiate the call and connect to the user’s browser or phone).
	•	Integrated AI Services: Vapi’s integration with tools like OpenAI, Deepgram, and ElevenLabs ￼ means we just supply API keys for those services and configure which ones to use for our agent. For example, in Vapi we might configure: Transcription=Deepgram, LLM=OpenAI-GPT4, TTS=ElevenLabs (voice “Jenny” for instance). This modular approach (bring-your-own-model) gives us flexibility and control ￼.
	•	Testing Tools: Vapi offers automated testing of voice agents ￼ – we can simulate calls to ensure the agent responds correctly to certain inputs. We’ll use this to QA our scenarios (especially the branching logic and to prevent AI hallucinations in responses).
	•	Clerk (Authentication & User Management) – Clerk provides a complete user authentication solution that easily plugs into Next.js. We’ll use it for email/password login, magic links or SSO in future, and managing user sessions. Clerk will save us from implementing auth from scratch and offers nice pre-built UI components for sign-in, sign-up, user profile management, etc. It also supports features like user invitations and organization management (which might align well with our multi-tenant needs). Using Clerk’s frontend components and middleware will ensure only authenticated users access the app and that we have JWTs/tokens to identify the user in server calls securely.
	•	Resend (Email Delivery) – Resend is an email delivery service aimed at developers. We’ll integrate Resend to send system emails, such as: invitation emails, passwordless login links (if using that), training assignment notifications, and the feedback reports. Resend allows using transactional email templates and has a simple API. We might use Resend’s React email templates to craft nice-looking emails. This service ensures high deliverability and simplifies email sending compared to running our own SMTP.
	•	Stripe (Payments) – Stripe will handle subscription payments and billing. We will use Stripe Checkout for new subscriptions (redirect to a Stripe-hosted checkout page for secure payment entry), and Stripe Billing for managing recurring subscriptions. On our backend, we’ll listen to Stripe webhooks (e.g. payment succeeded, subscription canceled, invoice payment failed) to update our app’s subscription status in the database. Additionally, we’ll integrate the Stripe Customer Portal so customers (admins) can manage their plan and payment info without building a custom UI. Each organization in our app will be linked to a Stripe Customer ID and have metadata like plan type and status. We can use Stripe’s pricing model to charge either per seat (e.g. $X per active trainee per month) or per usage (e.g. include Y hours of AI call time, with overage fees). Initially, a simple tiered per-user pricing is easiest, with maybe a usage cap per tier.
	•	Additional Tools & Considerations: During development and production, we’ll also use:
	•	GitHub (or similar) for source control and CI/CD (though deploying on Vercel means each git push can auto-deploy).
	•	Testing frameworks like Jest/React Testing Library for unit and integration tests of the front end and possibly some backend logic. For end-to-end testing, we might use Playwright/Cypress to simulate user flows (though voice calls are harder to test E2E; we might mock those or use Vapi’s testing).
	•	Monitoring & Logging: We will integrate monitoring for our production app. Vercel provides some observability, and we can add Sentry for error tracking on both frontend and backend. For the AI/voice components, we’ll log important events (call start, end, errors, AI responses) to debug issues. Vapi likely has a dashboard for call analytics we can use as well.
	•	Analytics (product usage): We might include an internal analytics tool to see how the platform is used (e.g. how often scenarios are played, average session length) to inform improvements. This could be something like PostHog or a simple custom logging to Supabase.

This tech stack is quite comprehensive but each piece is chosen for a purpose, and much of it is serverless or managed, reducing DevOps overhead. It’s similar to known successful SaaS starter kits which use Next.js + Supabase + Stripe + Tailwind UI ￼ ￼, augmented with AI and voice-specific components.

Implementation Plan & Phases

Building this platform will be an involved process. We’ll approach it in phases, ensuring a solid foundation (MVP) before layering on enhancements like AI content generation and mobile apps. Below is a high-level plan:

Phase 1: MVP – Core Functionality

Goal: Deliver a functional product that supports the end-to-end flow of a trainee completing a voice simulation and getting feedback, with basic management features for an organization. Target timeline ~3-4 months development for an initial launch.

Scope:
	•	User Authentication & Org Setup: Integrate Clerk for sign-up/login. Build the onboarding flow for a new organization (Admin registers, creates org, invites users). Basic org settings page (manage subscription, invite users).
	•	Scenario Playback (Single-Path for MVP): Implement the ability for a trainee to select an assigned scenario and engage in a call with the AI agent. For MVP, we might limit branching complexity and have more scripted agent responses (still using LLM but closely following a script) to reduce unpredictability. Ensure the call can be done via web audio. Use Vapi or Twilio+OpenAI directly if needed to get a working prototype.
	•	Recording & Transcription: After call, obtain the full transcript (could use Vapi’s transcript if available, or process the recording with Whisper as a fallback). Store the transcript and audio file.
	•	Basic Feedback & Scoring: Implement analysis of the transcript for at least 2-3 key metrics (talk ratio, maybe one scenario-specific check, filler words count). Compute a simple score and generate a feedback text (the prompt can be simple in MVP, e.g. feed the transcript to GPT-4 with “Give a short critique…”). Display the feedback to the user.
	•	User Dashboard: Trainee can see their past results (list of scenarios with scores, click to view details transcript+feedback).
	•	Manager/Admin Dashboard (MVP): Provide a minimal interface for an admin to create a scenario manually (a form with fields for description and maybe expected phrases). Admin can assign that scenario to a user. Provide a simple table of users and their latest score or completion status for managers/admins.
	•	Notifications: Send email to user after scenario with summary (and maybe a link to detailed results). If possible, send email to manager when their direct report completes a scenario. Use Resend for these.
	•	Stripe Integration: Set up Stripe for subscription – perhaps just a single “Pro Plan” with per-user pricing. Make sure new org registration ties into a Stripe checkout unless in trial. Enforce user limit if any (or just monitor).
	•	Polish & Testing: Ensure the UI (with ShadCN components) is polished for the above flows. Test the voice calls in various conditions (clear speech vs heavy accent to see STT performance). Ensure no major bugs.

Deliverable: A working web application that an organization can use to conduct at least one or two training scenarios and see results. This MVP might be limited in AI sophistication (e.g. agent might occasionally give a generic response if off-script, feedback may not cover every nuance), but it will prove the concept end-to-end. We’d likely pilot this with a small group of users (e.g. a few loan officers) to gather feedback.

Phase 2: Enhanced AI & Feature Expansion

Goal: Build on the MVP by adding the full range of features and AI capabilities discussed, making the product robust and value-rich. This phase could be another ~3-6 months of development, overlapping with MVP feedback.

Scope:
	•	AI Scenario Generation: Implement the interface for admins to generate scenarios via AI. This includes a form for prompt input and an under-the-hood call to an LLM to create the scenario content. Add the branching scenario editor UI – possibly a visual flow editor or at least a way to add alternate AI messages for different trainee responses.
	•	Advanced Evaluation Metrics: Introduce more KPI calculations: sentiment analysis (could use a service or simplistic approach via keywords for MVP, but aim to incorporate something like AWS Comprehend or a fine-tuned model for tone), more complex keyword/phrase checks (e.g. using embeddings to detect if a concept was mentioned even if wording is different). Possibly integrate a service like Hume AI for vocal emotion analysis via the audio (Hume provides emotion detection from voice).
	•	Leaderboards & Gamification: Develop the leaderboard views, achievement badges for trainees, and perhaps a “streak” counter (e.g. did training daily for a week, etc.). Ensure this is configurable (some companies might turn off public leaderboards).
	•	Tracks & Curriculum: Expand the assignment system to support tracks (multiple scenarios in sequence). Allow setting prerequisites (must pass scenario A before scenario B). Implement due dates and auto-reminders.
	•	Webhooks & Integrations: Build the Integrations settings in admin panel. Allow admin to add a webhook URL, select events, and specify a secret for signing. Implement sending of those webhooks on the backend. Test with sample endpoints (we can provide a small JSON bin or request catcher for their testing). Perhaps also provide a couple of one-click integrations: e.g. a toggle to send events to Slack (via Slack webhook URL) formatted nicely, or to MS Teams. If any early clients use a specific CRM, consider adding a direct integration (e.g. sending scores to a Salesforce record via their API).
	•	Improved Admin Tools: Add versioning to scenario content (so admins can update scenarios without losing old data, and have a history of changes). Provide duplication feature for scenarios/tracks. Possibly add a content import feature (if we prepare a set of default scenarios for loan officers, the admin can import those as a starting pack).
	•	Scalability & Stability: With more features in play, ensure the system scales. Possibly move heavy processing (transcription, feedback generation) to background jobs if needed (e.g. using Next.js Middleware or edge functions, or queue systems). At this stage, consider whether a dedicated backend (Node server or serverless functions) is needed beyond Next API routes for reliability. Load test the voice calls and database to handle, say, an org with 100 trainees all doing scenarios in a short span.
	•	UI/UX Refinements: Gather feedback from MVP users and improve the usability. This might include making the call interface more user-friendly (e.g. showing a “connected” status, a timer, perhaps options to pause or end the call), improving the feedback report layout (maybe a printable PDF of the report for HR records), etc. Also ensure mobile web browser compatibility even before a native app (some may use it on phone browser).
	•	Security & Compliance: If any early adopter clients require it, implement features like SSO (SAML integration), audit logging (recording who accessed what data), and compliance training tracking for HR. For example, an export of training results for HR audits.

By the end of Phase 2, the product should be production-ready for a wider launch: supporting robust content creation, rich analytics, and integration into the sales org’s ecosystem. It will be on par with or exceeding competitor offerings in terms of AI-driven coaching capabilities ￼ ￼.

Phase 3: Mobile App & Additional Innovations

Goal: Expand platform accessibility and continue improving the training experience. (Timeline flexible; this can begin once the web app is stable, perhaps around month 6-9.)

Scope:
	•	Mobile Companion App: Develop a React Native app (using Expo for easier cross-platform deployment) to allow trainees to practice on the go. The mobile app would let a user do everything the web app does in terms of taking training: start a call simulation (using the phone’s microphone and speaker), possibly download scenarios for offline practice (could we allow a fully on-device simulation with a smaller model? or at least allow practicing without perfect network – to be explored). The app would sync with the main system via APIs. It can send push notifications for training reminders or new assignments. Having a mobile app is beneficial as reps can practice anytime (e.g. on their commute with headphones, etc.).
	•	Live Call Coaching Integration (Future Idea): Although the core is simulated calls, a natural expansion is to integrate with real sales calls. For example, connect to a VOIP system or call recording system (like Gong or Aircall) to ingest actual client call recordings and then provide similar AI feedback on those. That would make the platform both a training and a real-world coaching tool. This could be a separate module or an enterprise add-on. Implementation would involve integration with telephony or Zoom/Teams recordings and running our analysis pipeline on those. (This is longer-term and might be beyond the immediate scope, but worth noting as a vision).
	•	Content Marketplace: As more scenarios are built, especially AI-generated, we could offer a marketplace or library where admins can share or purchase scenario packs (e.g. a “Financial Services Sales Pack” or “Retail Sales Training Pack”). This drives additional value and potentially revenue (if we sell premium content). Technically, this means a system to export/import scenarios across orgs, and a UI to browse available scenarios.
	•	Multi-Language Support: Expand to support training in other languages for global clients. Vapi and our chosen models support many languages (100+ languages for voice agents are possible ￼). We’d need to ensure our UI is localizable and the AI can handle the language (e.g. using an LLM with multilingual support or a local model for that language, and TTS/STT in that language). This could open up new markets (e.g. training call center reps in Spanish, French, etc.).
	•	Enhanced AI Capabilities: Continue refining the AI:
	•	Possibly use fine-tuned smaller models for faster responses (to reduce cost and dependency on big models for each call).
	•	Explore using emotion in the AI agent – e.g. AI voice gets “angry” if the scenario calls for an angry customer, etc.
	•	A/B test different AI agent personalities or approaches and see which yields better training outcomes (Vapi even suggests A/B experimenting on prompts ￼).
	•	Real-time feedback: maybe during the call, if the trainee is really going off-track, the agent could give a hint or the system could display a prompt (though too much real-time intervention might break immersion, so this would be optional or for practice mode).
	•	API for External Use: Down the line, expose parts of the platform via API so companies can, for example, trigger a training session from their LMS (Learning Management System) or pull training data into their internal dashboards. This would involve documenting endpoints and possibly offering developer API keys.

Project Management and Timeline

We’ll use an Agile approach with 2-week sprints. Early sprints focus on the most critical pieces (voice call functionality, basic UI, etc.). We will have frequent demos, especially after Phase 1 MVP, to course-correct with user feedback. Given the complex AI aspects, we plan to allocate time for experimentation (prompt tuning, testing different STT/TTS for best results).

Risks & Mitigations:
	•	Accuracy of AI – If the AI agent misinterprets the user or gives a bizarre response (hallucination), it could derail the training. Mitigation: use high-quality STT (Deepgram) for accuracy, constrain the LLM with scenario context and maybe chain-of-thought prompting to stick to role. Use Vapi’s testing to catch odd responses ￼. Have a fallback in conversation (if AI is confused, it can say “Could you clarify?” rather than something nonsensical).
	•	Latency – Real-time conversation needs low latency. Using streaming and fast models is key. We’ll optimize the pipeline (transcribe partial audio while user is still speaking, start formulating response). We may need to adjust model parameters or use faster endpoints to ensure the agent responds within a second or two after user stops talking.
	•	User Adoption – Some salespeople might be skeptical of an AI trainer. We should ensure the scenarios are realistic and the feedback is clearly beneficial (maybe allow them to rate the feedback quality to continually improve it). Also we might include a bit of fun element (like the gamification) to encourage usage.
	•	Cost – AI model usage (especially GPT-4) and voice API minutes have costs. We must optimize usage: e.g. limit each scenario to a reasonable length, perhaps compress the conversation context when possible, and possibly use cheaper models for transcripts or analysis where acceptable. We will include cost monitoring and perhaps usage limits in plans to control this. As usage grows, we can negotiate better rates or consider hosting open-source models.

By the end of these phases, we anticipate having a production-ready application deployed on Vercel, with Supabase backing, and various third-party services integrated (Clerk, Stripe, Vapi, etc.). The app will be fully capable of onboarding enterprise clients and scaling with them, offering a cutting-edge solution for sales training via audio AI agents. We will continue to iterate with new technologies (for example, if new LLMs or voice models come out, we can integrate them) to maintain a competitive edge in the training industry.

Conclusion

This PRD outlined the vision, requirements, and plan for a next-generation sales training SaaS leveraging AI voice agents. By combining realistic voice simulations, instant AI-driven feedback, and robust enterprise features, the platform aims to significantly improve how sales teams train and retain best practices. We detailed a tech stack (Next.js, Supabase, ShadCN UI, Vercel AI SDK, Vapi, Clerk, Resend, Stripe) that is capable of delivering these features in a scalable way, backed by references to successful patterns ￼ ￼ and cutting-edge AI integrations ￼ ￼. The implementation plan breaks the work into manageable phases, focusing first on core functionality and then on enhancements like AI content generation, integrations, and mobile support.

With this foundation, we are set to build a production-ready application that can be deployed and begin delivering value to organizations. The end result will be a platform that not only trains salespeople effectively through realistic practice but also provides management with data-driven insights to coach their teams better ￼. Ultimately, this leads to more confident sales reps, more consistent sales conversations across the organization, and improved sales performance – fulfilling the core goal of the product.
