## The $100M Offer Framework

### Grand Slam Offer Components

A Grand Slam Offer is so good, people feel stupid saying no. Our offer is built on four pillars:

#### 1. Dream Outcome (What They Want)

**Primary Promise**:
> "Turn your average reps into top performers in 30 days—without expensive coaches or time-consuming role plays."

**Dream Outcomes by Persona**:

**Sales Manager**:
- Team average goes from 68% to 85% in 60 days
- Stop losing deals to objections
- Onboard new reps in 1 week instead of 3 months

**VP of Sales**:
- Predictable quota attainment across all reps
- Reduce cost-per-rep from $15K to $3K
- Scale team without quality drop

**HR/Training Director**:
- Measurable training ROI with hard metrics
- Compliance tracking and certification
- Automated onboarding reduces manual work 80%

---

#### 2. Perceived Likelihood of Achievement (Why They'll Believe)

**Proof Mechanisms**:

**1. Real-Time Scoring**:
- "Every call is scored against 12 proven KPIs—no guessing"
- Show dashboard with immediate feedback

**2. AI Personas That Feel Real**:
- "Trained on 10,000+ real sales calls"
- Prospects raise actual objections, not scripted ones

**3. Progressive Difficulty**:
- "Start with easy scenarios, advance as you improve"
- 78% of users hit 85+ score by week 4

**4. Social Proof**:
- "SolarMax increased close rates 23% in 60 days"
- "MortgageFirst cut onboarding from 90 to 21 days"

**5. Risk Reversal**:
- 30-day money-back guarantee
- "If your team doesn't improve, we refund 100%"

---

#### 3. Time Delay (How Fast)

**Speed to Value**:
- **Day 1**: Assign first scenario, rep completes call, receives feedback
- **Week 1**: Rep has 5 reps under belt, confidence up
- **Week 4**: Measurable improvement in real calls (tracked via CRM integration)
- **Month 2**: Team average up 10-15 points

**Messaging**:
> "Most reps see improvement after their 3rd practice call. That's 45 minutes, not 45 days."

**Fast Wins**:
- Instant AI feedback (no waiting for manager review)
- Train anytime, anywhere (no scheduling constraints)
- Pre-built scenarios for common industries (instant setup)

---

#### 4. Effort and Sacrifice (How Easy)

**Minimal Effort Required**:
- ✅ No complex software to learn (if you can use Zoom, you can use this)
- ✅ No live trainer scheduling (train at 6 AM or 11 PM)
- ✅ No travel or expensive offsites
- ✅ No paperwork or manual tracking (auto-syncs to your dashboard)

**Messaging**:
> "Your reps spend 15 minutes a day. Your managers spend 15 minutes a week. That's it."

**Comparison**:
| Old Way | Voice AI Training |
|---------|-------------------|
| Schedule role-play with manager | Start call in 10 seconds |
| Manager manually scores call | AI scores instantly with breakdown |
| Feedback in 2-3 days | Feedback in 30 seconds |
| Limited scenarios | Unlimited practice |
| Embarrassment in front of peers | Private, judgment-free |

---

### Value Equation

```
Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood of Achievement) / (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)
```

**Our Value Equation**:
- Dream Outcome: 10/10 (Turn average reps into top performers)
- Likelihood: 9/10 (AI + proven scoring + social proof)
- Time Delay: 1/10 (Results in days, not months)
- Effort: 1/10 (15 min/day, zero setup)

**Result**: 90x value vs. traditional training

---

## Pricing Strategy

### The Power of Pricing

**Core Principle**: Price communicates value. Low price = low trust.

### Pricing Tiers

**Starter** – $49/user/month
- 10 users
- 100 practice sessions/month
- Basic scenarios
- Email support
- **Target**: Small teams testing the waters

**Professional** – $199/user/month (Most Popular)
- 50 users
- Unlimited practice sessions
- Custom scenarios
- Priority support
- Integrations (Salesforce, HubSpot)
- Manager dashboards
- **Target**: Growing sales teams (10-50 reps)

**Enterprise** – Custom pricing
- Unlimited users
- White-label option
- Dedicated success manager
- API access
- Custom integrations
- **Target**: Large orgs (100+ reps)

### Pricing Psychology

**Anchoring**:
- Lead with Enterprise features, then show Pro as "affordable"
- Compare to cost of sales trainer ($100K/year)

**Value Framing**:
> "For the cost of 2 Starbucks per day per rep, get world-class sales training."

**ROI Calculator**:
```
Average Deal Size: $10,000
Close Rate Increase: +5% (conservative)
Reps on Team: 20
Additional Deals per Month: 10
Additional Revenue: $100,000/month
Cost of Voice AI Training: $3,980/month
ROI: 25x
```

Subject: [First Name], quick question about [Company] sales training

[First Name],

I was looking at [Company]'s LinkedIn and noticed you've grown your sales team by [X]% this year—congrats!

Quick question: How are you currently ramping new reps?

Most VPs we work with say onboarding takes 3+ months and still, 40% of reps miss quota.

We've helped companies like [Similar Company] cut ramp time to 21 days using AI voice simulation.

Worth a 15-min call to see if it's a fit?

[Your Name]
```

**Email 2** (Day 3):
```
Subject: Re: [First Name], quick question

[First Name],

Not sure if you saw my message below.

Here's why I'm reaching out specifically to you:

[Company] is in [Industry], where objection handling is EVERYTHING.

We've built 50+ industry-specific scenarios so your reps practice real objections before they blow real deals.

[Similar Company] saw a 23% close rate increase in 60 days.

15 minutes to see if we can help?

[Calendar Link]
```

**Email 3** (Day 7):
```
Subject: [Company] + Voice AI Training (case study)

[First Name],

Last one from me!

Thought you'd want to see this: [Similar Company] used our platform to train 45 loan officers on rate objections.

Result: Close rate up 23% in 8 weeks.

Full case study here: [Link]

If you're not interested, no worries—just reply "not interested" and I'll stop reaching out.

Otherwise, here's my calendar: [Link]

## Sales Process

### Demo Script

**Opening** (2 min):
"Thanks for hopping on. Before I dive in, tell me—what's the biggest challenge you're facing with sales training right now?"

*[Listen, take notes]*

**Transition**:
"Got it. So if I'm hearing you right, the issue is [restate their pain]. And that's costing you [quantify pain]. Does that sound about right?"

**Demo** (8 min):
"Let me show you how this works. I'm going to start a practice call right now. Watch what happens..."

*[Screen share, start call, show AI responding in real-time]*

"See how the AI pushed back? That's a real objection. Now watch the scoring..."

*[Show instant feedback, breakdown, improvement tips]*

"Your reps do this 3 times a week. By week 4, they're handling objections you've never heard them handle before."

**Closing** (3 min):
"So here's what I recommend: We start with a 30-day pilot. You pick 10 reps, assign them 5 scenarios. In 30 days, we'll compare their scores and—more importantly—their real call performance. If you don't see improvement, full refund. What do you think?"

**Objection Handling**:

**"We need to think about it."**
> "I get it. Let me ask—is it the price, the timing, or something else?"

**"We're already using [Competitor]."**
> "That's great—how's it working? Specifically, are your reps actually using it? Because the #1 complaint we hear is low engagement. Our platform has 87% weekly active usage because reps actually want to practice."

**"We don't have budget."**
> "I appreciate that. Quick question—what's one lost deal worth to you? $10K? $50K? If we help you close 2 extra deals per quarter, does that justify the investment?"
