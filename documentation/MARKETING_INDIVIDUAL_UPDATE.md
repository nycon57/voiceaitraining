**Q: Do I need sales experience to use this?**
A: No! Our Free plan is perfect for beginners. Start with easy scenarios and progress at your own pace.

**Q: Can I upgrade from Individual to Team later?**
A: Absolutely. You can convert your personal workspace to a team account anytime—all your progress stays.

A: Upgrade to Pro ($29/month) for 100 sessions, or wait until next month when your free sessions reset.

**Q: Can I cancel anytime?**
A: Yes, all plans are month-to-month with no contracts.

---

### Team FAQs (Existing - Keep)

**Q: How long does onboarding take?**
A: 15 minutes. We'll help you invite your team and assign first scenarios.

**Q: Can managers listen to calls?**
